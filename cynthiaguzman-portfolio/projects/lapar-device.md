The focus of this project was on improving a low-cost system for Laparoscopic Skills Training. The original design was created by the Morimoto Lab at UCSD. One of the main successes of this device is that it uses customized instruments whose movement and control are used as inputs for video games to improve engagement.

I was tasked with further improvements including creating a hinged box design as well as decreasing weight and cost.

## Tool Control Mechanism

​The main part of my work was on redesigning the mechanism that took the user movement as input to the system. The previous system utilized an encoder and scroll wheel to measure movement in the Z-direction and a joystick (from a controller) to measure the XY-directions.

Since the goal was to lower cost, I decided to go with a 3D printed design where gyroscopic rods, rotary potentiometers, and a linear potentiometer were used.

There was a lot to consider with this design. I was concerned about it's strength and smoothness. Ideally, we want to mimic the resistance and range of a traditional laparoscopic training device. I had various prototypes with slight changes to the design in order to arrive at the final design shown below.
