##  Project Overview
â€‹This was a small side project. The idea was to create chess pieces with the piece name as the main body. It was especially challenging and fun to create unusual shapes using different tools in Inventor. This was also my first time using any kind of CAD software and it really helped me understand how to design for 3D printing integrity.
