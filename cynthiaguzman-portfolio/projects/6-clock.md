##  Project Overview
â€‹The focus on this project was on learning basic assembly techniques on Inventor. This was my first time trying using joints and constraints in Inventor.


In addition, I designed the escapement wheel and treble clef pendulum in Inventor. I chose a treble clef because I love music and I thought the shape would easily fit the 8 bolts that are used as weights.


I found it fun to design the pendulum and got more experience using splines.
