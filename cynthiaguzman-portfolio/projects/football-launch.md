​In this challenge, teams were tasked to use Fusion 360 to design a ball-striking or launching machine, that fits in a 4’ x 4’ footprint and is capable of delivering a standard US football over a cross-bar 10’ high, 99 yards away, between uprights of infinite height and 18’ 6’’ apart.

This was a challenge done remotely, so to prove our machine would work, energy analysis and a prototype were necessary.

For our team, The Double Double, we decided to construct a launching machine that uses the potential energy of eight springs. The main mechanism sits on a 4x4 rail frame and is loaded using a gear system

I designed the prototype of this using cardboard, paper, a rubber band, a paperclip, chopsticks, and some coins.
