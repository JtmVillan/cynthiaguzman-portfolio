The applications for swimming robots are many, ranging from ocean exploration and monitoring to trash cleanup. Biomimetic fish robots are swimming robots that are inspired by the swimming movement of actual fish. These robots are more efficient because of their increased agility and swimming performance. This project further develops the idea of a biomimetic fish by utilizing bio-inspired motor feedback to achieve autonomous swimming with minimal control.

## Goals and Design
The goal of this project is to design and fabricate a biomimetic swimming robot that has a compliant tail and uses a wheel and wire mechanism to change its curvature. The full assembly is made of a combination of 3D printed and acrylic lasercut pieces. From initial testing in air, we found that the tail of our robot would get stuck in certain positions, and reducing the number of vertebrae (joints) resulted in less jamming.

The main body of the swimming robot is a 6in sewer pipe. The head is a hollow, 3-D printed cone that houses the arduino and power source. The pipe houses the DC motor, the motor stand (made of acrylic and 3-D printed parts) and wheel. A keel is used as a counterbalance to reduce the chance of the robot rolling underwater. The complaint tail is composed of 3-D printed vertebrae and an acrylic tail. For waterproofing, the pipe has a rubber sheet lining both sides and two covers are bolted to either side.

## Tests and Results
We did initial testings of our robot in air by collecting spatial data on the tail locomotion with different number of vertebrae (one, two and three vertebrae). From our experiment, we found that in order to maintain a flexible tail design (to increase the number of vertebrae in the tail), we will have to implement a mechanism that restricts the total angle the tail is able to travel. This means that we have to spend more time on the design of our robot before moving onto underwater testing.
