Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, arises from temporary or permanent injury to the facial nerve. There have been limited studies on the effect of facial palsy on musicians. In the case of woodwind musicians, sound is produced by using a specific embouchure (the coordination of the cheek, mouth, tongue, and teeth when playing an instrument). For many professional or long-term musicians with facial palsy, the inability to play is devastating. 


The goal of our project is to create an assistive device to support the creation of the embouchure for a patient with partial facialy palsy of our sponsor and retired saxophone musician of 20 years.

## Project Objectives

There are limited research on devices that assist the creation of the embouchure for musicians with facial paralysis. Previous iterations done by others were [uncomfortable for long-term playing](https://www.saxontheweb.net/threads/tools-for-facial-paralysis-and-playing-the-saxophone.157990/) or had [very expensive manufacturing and material costs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022391315001791?via%3Dihub). 

For this project, we'll be focusing on the tenor saxophone. Qualitatively, we want to create a device that: 

* can attach to the instrument
* creates a seal with the mouth and mouthpiece enough to produce a note
* is safe 
* is comfortable
* is inexpensive 

We will also compare the quality of sound (air pressure and air velocity) with and without the device to a musician that has full facial control.

## Final Device Performance Summary

To quantify the performance results, pressure measurements were taken from the patient with and without the device. Measurements were also taken and from a volunteer saxophonist to serve as the control.  All pressures were plotted versus time and overlaid to directly see the differences.

<figcaption>Pressure Performance: Control pressure readings (red) average at 22.13 pascals. Pressure readings from the patient without a device (green) average at 14.99 pascals. Patient pressure measurements with the final device (black) average at 20.93 pascals. </figcaption>

In order to see how much pressure is required to play the saxophone, we measured the pressure range from a musician with full playing capacity. All tests were done under the same conditions and with the same note for consistency. The average pressure needed to sustain a G note was 22.13 pascals. The next step was taking the pressure from the patient without any device to see how much pressure he could input on his own. The average for the patient without assistance is 14.99 pascals, which is approximately 7 pascals less than the control. Fortunately, the patient has some control over his embouchure so there the margin of error was not too large. However, there were still air leaks which prevented him from generating quality notes. The measurements in black show the patient with the device and we see an increase in pressure from 14.99 to 20.93 pascals. The average pressure with the device is now only 1.3 pascals less than the control--showing great advancement. Not only do the numbers show improvement, but the patient is able to play clear, loud notes with the device and without any air leaks
